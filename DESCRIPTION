Description: This package was designed to allow the detection of copy number
    variation (CNV) from standard genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. Developed
    with populations of fast neutron mutants in mind, it compares the depth of
    sequencing in discrete genomic windows between individuals, segments the
    sequencing depth profiles to identify homozygous deletions, hemizygous
    deletions, and duplications. The functions included in this package provide
    the utilities needed for going from a set of BAM alignment files to a set
    of CNVs as well as high-level plotting functions to allow visualizing the 
    output.
