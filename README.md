# delgbs

## What is delgbs?

*delgbs* is an `R` package which provides tools for detecting copy number variation from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. *delgbs* bases its CNV calls on the number of reads per sample in discrete bins (e.g. 1-kb bins) located along a reference genome. Given a set of samples, *delgbs* tallies the number of reads per sample and per bin, and then compares the number of reads found in a sample to the population mean by computing a log2 ratio of the relative number of reads in a given bin for a given sample. The log2 ratio profiles thus generated are then segmented using a segmentation algorithm implemented by the package [`robseg`](https://github.com/guillemr/robust-fpop) and segments are categorized as homozygous deletions, hemizygous deletions or duplications according to their average log2 ratio. High-level plotting functions are also provided by the package as a convenience for users.

## Installation

*delgbs* can be installed directly in `R` by calling `devtools::install_github("malemay/delgbs")`. This will directly fetch the package from GitHub and install it on your computer. This requires  [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) to be installed on your computer. This package is available from CRAN through the usual `Ã¬nstall.packages()` interface.

*delgbs* requires a few [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) packages to be installed on your computer. You can install them by running the following commands in `R`:

```r
{
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite()
biocLite(c("Rsamtools", "S4Vectors", "GenomicRanges", "IRanges", "BiocGenerics"))
}
```

*delgbs* also requires the package *robseg* which can be installed from GitHub by running the command `devtools::install_github("guillemr/robust-fpop")` in `R`.

## Typical usage
The documentation for *delgbs* has yet to be completed. A vignette describing typical usage of the package and example datasets will be uploaded shortly.

## Known issues
None at the moment.
